# Missing Functions Report

This report compares the functions listed in `/docs/function-implementation-checklist.md` (marked with üìù) against the functions actually implemented in `/src/data/individualFunctionTests.ts`.

## Summary

- **Functions marked with üìù in checklist**: 265
- **Functions found in individualFunctionTests.ts**: 385 total (but only 179 match the checklist)
- **Missing functions**: 86

## Critical Findings

1. **All basic operators are missing** - This is surprising as these are fundamental operations (+, -, *, /, comparison operators)

2. **Most financial functions are missing** - A significant portion of advanced financial calculations are not in the individual tests

3. **All cube functions are missing** - OLAP cube-related functions are completely absent

4. **Most web/import functions are missing** - Data import capabilities are largely untested

## Recommendation

The checklist claims that all 507 functions have individual tests, but this analysis shows 86 functions from the checklist are missing from individualFunctionTests.ts. Priority should be given to:

1. Basic operators (critical)
2. Commonly used financial functions
3. Web/import functions for data integration

Note: There may be a discrepancy between how functions are named in the checklist vs. the implementation file, or some functions might be tested differently.
